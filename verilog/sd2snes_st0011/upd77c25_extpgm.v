//
// External program memory for the ST011 uPD96050 core.
//
// The ST011 program is 16384 24-bit words, too large for on-chip memory. It
// lives in the board's Bus 2 SRAM (8-bit, 45 ns; 256 KB usable, ~49 KB used),
// which no other part of this core drives. Each word is stored as 3 bytes at
// byte address word*3, in the order the MCU sends them (PGM_DI); the
// byte-order correction to the true instruction is applied on read.
//
// Structure, in the order a fetch is served:
//   1. loop buffer   8 recent words in flip-flops, zero latency
//   2. pinned table  words 0..255 (every word used during DMA transfers),
//                    block RAM, prewarmed after the firmware download
//      cache         512-entry direct-mapped block RAM for all other words,
//                    filled on demand (both looked up in parallel)
//   3. SRAM          ~31 cycles per word (miss_latency_tb)
//
// No dependency on the core's RST: the MCU downloads the firmware (PGM_WR,
// $E9) while the DSP is held in reset, so this module must accept writes
// then. Power-up state comes from initial values applied at configuration.
//
// RAM_OE/RAM_WE are active low. Each byte access presents the address for
// one cycle with both deasserted before asserting OE or WE.
