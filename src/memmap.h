   memmap.h: PSRAM/BSRAM address map, shared with the SNES side
*/

/* THESE ADDRESSES ARE AN INTERFACE.  Every SRAM_, SS_ and MENU_ constant here is
   in LOCKSTEP with a define of the same meaning in snes/memmap.i65: the menu and
   the in-game shells read and write these very addresses, so moving one side alone
   shows up as garbage on screen, or a silently swallowed store, with no build
   error.  The whole map stays in this one file -- the bookkeeping comments in the
   free $FF0701..$FF07FF gap name their neighbours, which only holds while every
   claim on the gap can be read side by side.

   DO NOT include this from patch.c, patch.h, patch_copier.h, patchmeta.h, atari.c,
   atari.h or snes.h: the host test harness compiles those against
   tests/host/shim/memory.h, which replaces memory.h wholesale.

The fix blobs re-sync a WRAM shadow of the APU handshake with the live $214x port, but until now they only ran on savestate save/load (audio_fix in snes/savestate.a65). Star Ocean spins on that shadow with an UNBOUNDED loop inside its V-IRQ handler (LDA $2140 : CMP $2140 : BNE : EOR $4A : BPL, three sites reached from $C0:0221), so any drift across an overlay open/close deadlocks the handler on resume -- the picture stays exactly as the overlay restored it and the game never repopulates OAM (its sprites vanish), which is the reported field-scene freeze. Running the blob once more on close makes the spin pass. Opt-in per game on purpose: a blob is free-form code (some entries write immediates, one writes $2140 itself), so firing it on every overlay close for the whole library would be a far wider behaviour change.

   PSRAM banks $FA-$FC, the only contiguous SNES-visible hole big enough for a
   128 KiB WRAM snapshot plus a candidate bitmap. Why it is safe:
     - no other region in this header or in snes/memmap.i65 lives in $FA-$FC;
       the only tokens in the range were the dead SS_CODE/SS_DATA defines that
       snes/savestate.i65 marked "should be unused" (retired with this block).
     - the savestate image is $F00000..$F4FFFF and the FPGA mirrors are $F5-$F9,
       so init()'s sram_memset(0xF70000, 0x30000, 0) ends EXACTLY at $FA0000.
     - inside the in-game IS_PATCH window ($C0-$FF identity, held while the hook
       owns snescmd_unlock) only $F905xx/$F907xx (and $F90720 on the SA-1 core)
       are served by the FPGA; $FA-$FC is plain PSRAM on every core.
     - RAM0 is 16 MB on BOTH boards (see MT_RAM0_SIZE in src/memtest.c), so this
       does not fork Mk.II vs Mk.III.
   Like $F4 it is NOT cleared at game load and survives a short power-cycle, so
   the block is gated by its own magic, which trainer_stage() zeroes every load. */
