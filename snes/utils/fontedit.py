Decode/encode the 8x8 2bpp SNES tile font used by the sd2snes menu.

Each character in font.a65 is 16 bytes: 8 rows, each row being two bytes
(low plane, high plane). Pixel color = (high_bit << 1) | low_bit, with
MSB-first within each byte. Colors 1-3 are all visible foreground in the
menu palette.

Usage:
    python3 fontedit.py show <code>        Render a single char
    python3 fontedit.py addaccents         Insert PT-BR accented chars
    python3 fontedit.py addfrench          Insert French chars (è ù î ï ë û)
    python3 fontedit.py additalian         Insert Italian chars (ì ò È Ì Ò Ù)
    python3 fontedit.py addgerman          Insert German chars (ä ö ß Ä Ö)
    python3 fontedit.py addtourglyphs      Insert the onboarding tour's glyphs (241-243)
    python3 fontedit.py addbrowsericons    Insert the browser's file-type icons
    python3 fontedit.py addmouseglyphs     Insert the mouse-button glyphs (250-253)
    python3 fontedit.py fixcircumflex      Redraw the 8 circumflex tiles
    python3 fontedit.py addrussian         Insert Cyrillic (codes 177-223)
    python3 fontedit.py clearkatakana      Blank the leftover katakana (161-176)
    python3 fontedit.py addscrollbar       Write scrollbar glyphs (codes 16,17)
    python3 fontedit.py addprogressbar    Write progress-bar glyphs (codes 18,19)
    python3 fontedit.py export [opts]      Dump the font to an editable PNG
    python3 fontedit.py import <png> [opts]  Read a PNG sheet back into font.a65
    python3 fontedit.py freeslots          List slots with no glyph in them

The export/import pair is the pixel-editor round trip (Paint, Photoshop,
Aseprite, GIMP): `export` writes a 16x16 tile sheet plus an annotated guide,
`import` reads the edited sheet back. See the PNG SHEET section below for the
palette and the write-scope rules.

The PT-BR insertion writes 24 new tiles into empty slots and prints the
codepoint -> char mapping so const.a65 can reference them.

`addfrench` adds the DIAERESIS mark (ë ï) alongside the existing GRAVE/CIRC
marks and writes ONLY the 6 new slots (224-229), preserving every other tile
(so the hand-made Spanish glyphs and the art in 161-223 are untouched).

`additalian` follows the same targeted pattern for codes 230-235 and introduces
no new mark: every Italian glyph is the existing GRAVE over its base letter.

`addrussian` writes the 47 Cyrillic letters that need a tile of their own: 46
over the dead katakana block (178-223) and У at 177. The table holds the
literal art, hand-tuned after the native-speaker review, so on an up-to-date
font.a65 it is a no-op (tests/test_i18n_parity.py checks it). The other 19
letters are HOMOGLYPHS -- an existing tile already draws them -- and that
table is encode-only, never merged into ACCENT_MAP.

`addgerman` does the same for 236-240. It needs the diaeresis to be a mark of
its own, which is why CIRC was redrawn as 3 contiguous pixels: while the
circumflex was itself two dots, a+diaeresis was byte-identical to â, so ä could
not exist. `fixcircumflex` redraws the 8 tiles that carry the old mark; run it
before addgerman on a font that predates the change.

PNG SHEET
---------
`export` writes two files:

  font_sheet.png   the round-trip file: 16x16 tiles, no gutters, one image
                   pixel per font pixel (times --scale). THIS is the file to
                   edit and hand back to `import`. It mirrors font.a65 as it
                   stands, so a slot that still holds an old glyph shows it;
                   --blank hands over empty cells instead (PNG only, the .a65
                   changes on import).
  font_guide.png   read-only reference: same grid, but blown up and annotated
                   with the code of every cell, so it is obvious which cell is
                   which. Never imported.

The sheet is a 4-colour image and those four RGB values are the whole
contract; `import` maps every pixel back to a colour index by nearest match
and reports how many pixels were not an exact hit (antialiasing, a soft brush
or a JPEG round trip show up there):

  0 = magenta #ff00ff  transparent
  1 = white   #ffffff  glyph body
  2 = grey    #393939  outline / counter
  3 = grey    #a5a5a5  mid tone

Keep the pencil hard-edged and anti-aliasing off. Any indexed/RGB/RGBA PNG is
accepted on the way back, at any integer scale.

How the existing glyphs are shaded, worth copying for a new alphabet: the
letter itself is a fat white (1) shape, every side of it wrapped in the dark
outline (2) -- including the counters, so the hole in a 'B' is outline grey,
not transparent -- with the mid tone (3) dropped on single pixels where a
corner or a curve would otherwise look jagged. Transparent (0) only survives
in the outer corners and along the bottom row, which stays empty so stacked
menu rows do not touch. Copying an existing letter and reshaping its strokes
keeps a new script consistent far more easily than drawing one from scratch.

`import` defaults to --only 176,250-255 -- every slot still free: the tail
of the table (241-243 are the tour's arrows and progress line, TOUR_GLYPHS;
244-249 and 160-175 the browser's file-type icons, BROWSER_ICONS) plus the one
slot left of the dead katakana block (see RECYCLABLE_CODES: it is JIS X 0201
left over from the CP932 era, unreachable since 2010). A full-sheet write is not the default because it would silently
repaint the hand-made Spanish glyphs and the window art whenever an editor
shifted a colour. Widen it deliberately (--only 130-159, --all) once the diff
printed by --dry-run looks right.

7 slots are left; `freeslots` prints the current tally.

# collides with adjacent menu rows, while compressing the letter visibly
# damages it. These marks therefore never delete or move letter pixels. All
# top accents are compact marks on the original top row; tilde is reduced to a
# dash for readability. Cedilla keeps the old attached two-row shape.

# (ê==ë, î==ï, û==ü). German needs ä/ö as distinct letters, so the circumflex
# gives up the two-dot shape and keeps the row to itself. Each mark is now told
# apart by extent and position on the single available row: acute leans right,

# The Russian menu's second wall (see MENU-RUSSO-PLANO.md): the font is an

# fits because 19 letters are drawn by tiles that already exist -- 11 uppercase
# and 7 lowercase Latin homoglyphs, plus ё which IS ë (228) -- leaving 47 to
# draw: 46 over the dead katakana block (178-223) and У right below it (177).
#
# Each glyph is its LITERAL tile art in the ART_COLORS legend (. transparent,
# x body, X outline, # half tone), so `addrussian` writes font.a65 back byte for
# byte and tests/test_i18n_parity.py fails when the two drift. The first pass
# was drafted as strokes through `stroke_to_pixels`; the native-speaker review
# then redrew outlines and half tones by hand, which no stroke rule reproduces.
# A glyph fixed in font.a65 has to come back into this table. У is the tailed
# shape the Latin Y had before it got a straight stem.
#
# Grid, same as the Latin letters: uppercase and ascenders r0..r5, x-height
# r1..r5, descenders down to r6, r7 always empty so stacked menu rows do not
# touch. Ё/Й/й carry their mark on r0 like an accent.

# (ff.c), the internal ROM header title -- the other JIS X 0201 source -- is
# never displayed (smc.c only pattern-matches it), and no menu string uses the

#
# The range is not inert, it is actively wrong: under CP1252 an accented file

# $a5 magic; none is a tile index). Window borders are tiles 20-27, not these.
# Cyrillic took 178-223 and `clearkatakana` blanked the rest, so nothing is
# left in the "dead glyph still sitting there" state -- an empty 162-175 now
